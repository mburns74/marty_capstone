Collecting/Cleaning Data:
The data I wanted to analyze had to be compiled through web scraping methods in python. This data range consisted of data that dates back to the 1870's. It was also scattered in may different places. I created mulitple dataframes and then compiled them in excel for further exploritory data analysis. Finding all the data sources needed ****To be Continued Tomorrow



Challenges
It was a challenge to collect the data from so many different sources. The data collection alone through web scraping took alot of time and effort that extended beyond classroom time and into weekends, late nights and early mornings. Another challenge was laying out how this data set in a way that would accomidate xlookups, countifs, and allow me to leverage to tools within excel to build what would need to be fed into Tableau. Finally, determining what could be used as true measures of success was challenging. I intially thought I could use such data as population at the time of birth (rural vs urban), gender, ethnicity, etc to measure success but in the end those could not measure success. They did provide additional insights during the data analysis porition, so I included them in the capstone presentation as well. Biuldinga  custom website to present the capstone through was fun and a stretch as well.

Technologies Used
Python - for webscraping and collecting the dataframes needed and also for cleaning of data
Excel - For building a custom combined dataset that leveraging xlookups, countifs, and advanced filtering functions
Tableau - for creating visualizations
Google Sites - for capstone website creation
Git - for pushing python notebook to Github for version control
